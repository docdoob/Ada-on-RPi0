# Ada-on-RPi0

The bare board runtime libraries (bb-runtimes) for the RPi0 for the standard 3 profiles: Zero FootPrint, Ravenscar Small and Full.

The source of other runtimes is here:
  https://github.com/AdaCore/bb-runtimes
Only the Zero FootPrint library has been tested.  It is in rpio-runtimes/zfp-rpi0.
 
These runtimes were created by cloning the rpi2 information, altering this and then building as described in the link above.
