Ravenscar for Raspberry Pi 0 board
=====================================

Runtimes Supported
------------------

* ZFP
* Ravenscar-SFP
* Ravenscar-Full
Neither Ravenscar has been tested

Boot the board with an Ada program:
-----------------------------------

By default the board boots on the FAT-formatted SD-CARD.

On this sd-card, you need to have the following firmware files:

- bootcode.bin (required)
- start.elf (required)
- fixup.dat (required to use 1GB)

Those startup files can be found with the raspbian distribution.

Use gprbuild to build the application, then:

``$ arm-eabi-objcopy -O binary PROG PROG.bin``

and finally:

``$ cp PROG.bin /sdcard/kernel7.img``

Install the sdcard on the Pi, and power it up.

Resources that can be used by the runtime:
-----------------------------------------

- mini-uart (MU) for textio.

.. code-block:: none

    Uses pins of the GPIO port:
      5V +-+ GND
         | | | +--- TX
         | | | | +- RX
         1 2 3 4 5
     +----------------- ... ----+
     |/\ * * * * * *    ...     |
     |\/ * * * * * *    ...    USB
     |                         USB
     | #                        |

- Per core CNTP and CNTPCT (generic timer) for time
- The 64-bit timer in the local registers uses the crystal (19.2 Mhz)

Interrupts:
-----------

Interrupts 0 to 11 correspond to the core interrupt as described in
Quad-A7 control document, section 4.10

GPU interrupts are mapped to id 12 - 76.

For example, mini-uart interrupt is named Aux_int, is GPU interrupt #29 so
has Ada Interrupt_ID 41.

Memory mapping:
---------------
see RAM.ld

Boot:
-----

- Use the normal boot (starts at 0x8000).
